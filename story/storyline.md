# Story Outline

### General outline of the story.

### PREMISE/OPENING
The year is 20XX. Humans have made huge advancements in AI. However, a bug causes 90% of the robots to go berserk. The remaining robots are sent to fight the bugged robots, but all but the player are destroyed, and the player is left heavily damaged

### NOTES
* Presented in 8/16-bit era slides?
* Still a rip-off of Mega Man
* Keep it very simple, lighter tone.

### LEVEL ONE - "THE RESURRECTION"
* 'CUTSCENE' - Player wakes up among the ruins/remains of the allied army, crawls out. They locate a nearby communications beacon and set out to find it.
* Along the way, the player runs into bugged robots who try to stop the player.
* Reaching the beacon, the player contacts the humans, who are relieved that there is a survivor.

### LEVEL TWO - "THE ROAD BACK"
* 'CUTSCENE' - The player is told to find a nearby train which will transport them back to the human base.
* More bugged robots begin to arrive near the player's location, having been alerted to the fact that there was a non-bugged robot that survived.
* Reaching the ending, the player boards the train, but a bugged robot also attaches itself to the train.

### LEVEL THREE - "THE ORDEAL"
* 'CUTSCENE' - The player is receiving upgrades at the human base when a massive horde of bugged robots attack, bringing a ship with them.
* The player makes their way through the base to the ship, fighting their way through the robots before entering.

### LEVEL FOUR - "CROSSING THE THRESHOLD"
* Player confronts a massive robot constructed by the bugged robots.
* After the leader's defeat, the player activates a self-destruct mechanism in the giant robot (probably in a cutscene), sacrificing themselves to stop the bugged robots.

### ENDING - "THE ORDINARY WORLD"
* Now free of robots, the world restructures and moves on, restoring society to peace. The site of the mothership is made into a museum/memorial of sorts, the player hailed as a hero and "the last robot"
