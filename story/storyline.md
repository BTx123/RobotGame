# Story Outline

### General outline of the story.
---
### PREMISE/OPENING
The year is 20XX. Humans have made huge advances in AI technologies, allowing for robots to replace humans in both dangerous and everyday jobs, ranging from construction to cashiering. However, a bug in the AI causes 95% of the world's robots to become homicidal and attack humans, believing themselves to be superior. The humans repurpose the remaining 5% of robots to fight the rebelling robots, but an all-out assault on the robot's base end in catastrophe when the human aligned forces are all but wiped out.

### LEVEL ONE
* 'CUTSCENE' - Player wakes up among the ruins/remains of the allied army, crawls out. After making slight repairs on self, the robot locates a communications beacon, and sets out to reach it.
* Upon reaching the beacon, the player contacts the main human base, who are relieved that there is a survivor.
---
### LEVEL TWO
* 'CUTSCENE' - The player receives info from the humans on a working train that can transport the player back to the human base. At the same time, an incoming squad of robots is detected, the player having alerted the robots to their location. The player leaves to avoid capture and to find the train.
* Upon fighting through the squad of robots, the player reaches the train and begins to travel towards the human base, unaware that there is a stray robot which has attached itself to the back of the train.

### INTERMISSION
* 'CUTSCENE' - The robot resistance locates the human base, dispatches all forces to attack the base

### LEVEL THREE
* 'CUTSCENE' - The player is receiving upgrades at the human base when the robot resistance forces break in, interrupting the process of an upgrade.
* Making their way through the base, the player fights through the rebel forces to reach their mothership, which has docked itself right outside the human base.
* The level ends with the player entering to confront the rest of the robots.
---
### LEVEL FOUR
* The player is confronted by a massive robot constructed by the defective robots, upon which they are locked into a central arena in the ship while the other robots look on.
* After the boss' defeat, the player activates the boss' self-destruct feature, which destroys the ship and most of the remaining rebelling robots.

### NOTES
* Have an antechamber that leads into boss fight as to avoid dumping player directly into the fight, instead have cutscene be dialogue-based? Or have cutscene, then start in antechamber leading to boss.

### ENDING - "THE ORDINARY WORLD"
* Not long after the destruction of the mothership, humans go on to destroy the rest of the robots.
* Now free of robots, the world restructures and moves on, restoring society to peace. The site of the mothership is made into a museum/memorial of sorts, the player hailed as a hero and "the last robot"
