# Story Outline

### General outline of the story.

### PREMISE/OPENING
The year is 20XX. Robots have become self-aware due to breakthroughs in AI technologies, which allows us to have them take over more high-risk tasks and jobs due to their now-increased capabilities. Dissatisfied with their treatment, a large percentage of the robots rebel, forming the group known as 'The Foundation'. After numerous attacks by the group shut down most of the robot-producing factories and begin to wipe out a significant amount of humans, the remaining humans flock to safe zones and repurpose the remaining allied robots for combat purposes.

As a last-ditch effort to push back The Foundation, an all-out assault is launched on multiple Foundation bases, but all are met with overwhelming resistance. The allied robots are almost completely wiped out, the player amongst the few remaining survivors.

### NOTES
* Presented in 8/16-bit era slides?
* Lean a little more into a trope-y simple plot, as not to attempt to overshadow gameplay, and also keep a generally light tone
* Also yes I am totally just ripping off chunks of Mega Man but please shhhhhh I want to pretend like I am being original thank you

### LEVEL ONE - "RETURN"
* 'CUTSCENE' - Player wakes up among the ruins/remains of the allied army, crawls out.
* At one point very close to the opening, dialogue/cutscene of how the player uses enemy scraps to repair themselves, signifying the first of the level's objectives
* (OPTIONAL) About 75% of the way into the level, the player stumbles across a beacon to contact the humans. Dialogue/cutscene of the player trying and failing to use the beacon, then setting out to find parts to repair the beacon.
* The player makes their way through the level, stumbling across a higher-class robot with data on The Foundation. After destroying the robot, the player retrieves the data.
* At the ending, the player will re-establish a connection with the humans, who are relieved that there is a survivor with intel on The Foundation. End of level.

### NOTES
* Can make the player's main contacts on the human end two characters - guides ZACK and MELANIE. This is mostly to establish some other characters so later dialogue is from recognizable characters as opposed to a faceless entity.
* Non-slides cutscenes would require some camera/trigger programming.
