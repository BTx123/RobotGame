### SUMMARY
A classmate and I in high school began working on a game to test out Unity's various features. Since we didn't get to finish, I thought that completing the game would be great to continue learning and teaching others about game development.

The game is a 2D platformer that tells the story of a robot that has survived after human extinction. The world is filled with the remnants of human civilization and now only robots roam Earth. In an effort to grow stronger, each surviving robot seeks to 'eat' scrap to grow/repair themselves, some of them forming robot clans. The player plays a robot programmed by a human to destroy the remaining robots so that life can once again flourish on Earth. By eating scrap and developing its abilities, the robot will progress until no more robots exist, the point at which life will once again flourish.

The goal of the game is to reach the last level (of at least 3 levels) and defeat the boss in which the player must stay alive by constantly surviving through means of destroying other robots and eating scrap. Every robot destroyed will give the player more scrap to use in addition to the scrap spawned on the ground. Player health will slowly decrease due to 'hunger' and decrease greatly if hit by an enemy. Healing must be done through scrap that spawns in the map, crashes from the sky, or explodes from enemy robots.

Level 1 will consist of an introduction to the story and its basic mechanics. Basic enemies will roam the map aimlessly, they themselves also trying to find scrap to grow stronger. The player wins when the robot gains enough strength (i.e. collects enough scrap) to advance to the next level.

Level 2 will be harder than the last. Enemies will be seeking the player and attack more viciously, as well as be a little bigger with various other sprites. Once again, the 

Level 3 will be the hardest level. Upon beating all the boss's minions, the player must face a boss robot itself. Defeating the boss will allow the Earth to reseed, only to start the cycle all over again.
